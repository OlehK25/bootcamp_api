# 👩‍💻DevCamper API

> This is the backend API for the DevCamper platform, designed to be a comprehensive bootcamp directory.

## 🕸️ Overview

The project represents an extensive and detailed backend API that I have developed for DevCamper, a bootcamp directory platform. It allowed me to delve deeply into Node, Express, and MongoDB, and overcome various challenges encountered during the project's life cycle. 


## 🗒️ Technology Stack

The DevCamper API leverages a robust set of tools and technologies to deliver a seamless user experience:

- JavaScript: Provides interactivity and API request handling.
- Node.js: Server-side JavaScript execution.
- Express: A Node.js framework to simplify building complex server-side applications.
- MongoDB: Database for persistent data storage.
- Mongoose: A MongoDB object modeling tool.
- Mapbox: Map service for displaying bootcamp locations.
- JSON Web Token (JWT): User authentication.
- Nodemailer: Email service for communication with users.
